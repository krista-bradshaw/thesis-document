This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the existing body of literature that informs and supports the research presented in this thesis. It delves into the domains of large language models, enhancing retrieval pipelines, and evaluating retrieval systems. Furthermore, it examines the concept of query variation, shedding light on benchmark datasets, their impact on system performance, and the various methods employed for generating query variations. This chapter aims to present a detailed overview of the current state of knowledge in the field and identify the specific gaps and research areas this study seeks to address.

Query variations, as explored in this chapter, can originate from multiple sources, including the ambiguity in user search terms, diverse user intentions, and variations in the search context. This chapter meticulously evaluates the existing literature on query variation generators and their integration within Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to uncover the current state of research in this critical area and to pinpoint any notable gaps or opportunities for future investigation.
