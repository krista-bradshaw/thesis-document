\chapter{Introduction}
In the dynamic digital age, rapid and easy access to an immense repository of information has revolutionised the way we seek and consume knowledge. Retrieval pipelines, the technological backbone powering search engines and recommendation systems, are the linchpin in guiding us through this vast information landscape. These pipelines play an indispensable role in our daily lives, tirelessly toiling to unearth the most pertinent and precise results in response to our inquiries, making them a quintessential component of our digital existence.

The effectiveness of retrieval pipelines, however, is not solely dependent on their sophisticated algorithms and robust infrastructure. Their performance is inextricably linked to the myriad ways users formulate queries. Queries, far from being uniform, exhibit a wide array of variations encompassing nuances in wording, syntax, and structure. Despite these distinctions, the ultimate goal remains constant – to satisfy the user's underlying information requirement.

Recognizing how these variations exert their influence on the performance of retrieval pipelines is of paramount importance in the ongoing quest to ensure these systems remain in harmony with the ever-evolving needs of their users. These variations can introduce substantial challenges to the search and recommendation process. Understanding and addressing them is pivotal to maintaining the reliability and effectiveness of these systems in serving the ever-diversifying needs of a global population that relies on them as indispensable tools in navigating the information-rich digital landscape. It is this constant adaptation and evolution of retrieval pipelines that guarantees they continue to be the reliable guides we depend on in our digital quests for knowledge and information.

\section{Objectives and Scope}
This thesis embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the robustness and generalizability of findings from an original study conducted in information retrieval. The study in question, authored by Gustavo Penha, Arthur Câmara, and Claudia Hauf, is titled "Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval Pipelines with Query Variation Generators." Hereafter referred to as the "original study," this research has contributed invaluable insights into the performance of retrieval pipelines when subjected to variations in search queries. In particular, it has shed light on the limitations of these systems and proposed potential strategies for their improvement.

The present study is motivated by the pursuit of a deeper understanding of the behaviour of retrieval systems and the broader implications of the original study's findings, mainly when applied to different datasets and conditions. To accomplish this, two fundamental research questions guide the overarching themes of this investigation:

\textbf{Research Question 1 (RQ1): To what extent can the findings and observations from the original study be successfully replicated using the same datasets, models, and methodologies?}
\textbf{Research Question 2 (RQ2): How do the conclusions drawn from the original study generalise when applied to additional datasets, and what insights can be gained from this broader perspective?} 

\subsection{Research Question 1: Reproduction}
Research Question 1 delves deeply into the critical aspect of assessing the reproducibility of findings and observations from the original study, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the robustness and reliability of the original research. This is a pivotal step in scientific inquiry as it not only validates the credibility of the initial findings but also paves the way for further development and refinement of knowledge in the field.

To address this research question, the study meticulously recreates the experimental conditions, utilizing the same datasets, models, and methodologies employed in the original research. By doing so, it seeks to answer the fundamental question of to what extent the original study's results can be successfully replicated. This replication process is essential as it offers a crucial litmus test for the validity and trustworthiness of the original study's outcomes.

Moreover, the investigation of reproducibility is not just about confirming the original findings; it also serves as a means to uncover the intricacies and subtleties of the observed phenomena. By repeating the experiments under identical conditions, researchers gain a deeper insight into the inherent stability and robustness of these phenomena. This, in turn, contributes significantly to the development of more resilient retrieval pipelines, providing a solid foundation upon which future advancements can be built.

The objectives of Research Question 1 can be further delineated into two primary goals. First and foremost, it seeks to recreate the critical findings of the original study using the same datasets, models, and methodologies. This replication process is integral in determining the reliability and stability of the original observations. By successfully reproducing the results, it reinforces the credibility of the initial study's findings, adding weight to its scientific merit.

Secondly, Research Question 1 endeavors to identify any potential discrepancies or variations that may arise during the reproduction process. These deviations, if they occur, are not to be dismissed but rather subjected to thorough scrutiny. Researchers will meticulously analyze these discrepancies, aiming to uncover their underlying causes. These causal factors can encompass a myriad of variables, including differences in the characteristics of the datasets used, variations in model behaviour, or subtle nuances in the methodology employed. Understanding these variations is essential as it not only highlights potential limitations of the original study but also provides valuable insights into the broader context of the research, which can aid in refining future studies and enhancing the overall understanding of the field.

\subsection{Research Question 2: Expansion}
The second research question is a crucial aspect of our study, as it delves into the generalisability of the original study's conclusions when applied to additional datasets. The original study, while providing valuable insights, was confined to specific datasets, and this limited scope raises essential questions about the transferability of its findings to a broader context. In essence, we aim to ascertain how well the conclusions drawn from the original study extend to a more diverse spectrum of datasets, and this broader perspective is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena under investigation.

The objective of Research Question 2 is to systematically explore how the insights and conclusions of the original study stand up when exposed to a wide array of datasets beyond those initially considered. This involves the rigorous application of the same methodologies, models, and analytical tools used in the original study to these additional datasets. By subjecting these datasets to the same analytical lens, our research endeavours to uncover nuances and insights that may emerge in different dataset contexts. This process not only enhances our comprehension of the generalisability of the original study's findings but also contributes to a more robust understanding of retrieval pipeline behaviour across many scenarios.

By investigating the generalisability of the original study's conclusions in diverse dataset contexts, we can gain a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective on the studied phenomena. This approach allows us to identify overarching trends and patterns that may transcend the specific dataset used in the original research, thus expanding our knowledge and refining the conclusions drawn from the study. Ultimately, Research Question 2 contributes significantly to the depth and breadth of our research, offering a richer and more complete understanding of the subject matter.

\section{Project Timeline}
This section examines how the actual timeline of the thesis project aligned with the projected timeline outlined in the initial proposal, graphically represented in \fig{fig:gantt}. It is essential to highlight that while the project plan serves as a structured guide, unforeseen challenges and adjustments often occur during the execution of any research endeavour. In this case, deviations from the initially projected timeline impacted the project's progress.

\subsubsection{Project Initiation \& Pre-Processing}
The initiation phase of the project, Milestone 2, which was intended to focus primarily on pre-processing datasets, was instead utilizsd to set up the codebase and establish the computational environment. This deviation from the original plan was driven by the necessity to create a robust foundation for the subsequent phases of the project. Specifically, a Google Colab environment with GPU capabilities had to be set up to accommodate the resource-intensive tasks involved in the experiment reproduction and expansion. This process introduced some delays in the timeline, as configuring the GPU environment and ensuring compatibility with the required tools and libraries proved more time-consuming than initially anticipated.

As a result of this extension of the initial phase, the commencement of the "Reproduction of Experiments" milestone was postponed. Consequently, the time allocated for reproducing all experiments, as per the original study, was shorter than initially projected. There were some limitations in the extent of extra data analysis compared to the original study. However, it is important to note that all fundamental aspects of the project, including the implementation of ranking models and query generation, were diligently pursued.

\subsubsection{Impact on the Reproduction of Experiments}
Due to the delays experienced in the initial phase, the commencement of the "Reproduction of Experiments" milestone was postponed. Consequently, the time allocated for reproducing all experiments, as per the original study, was shorter than initially projected. There were some limitations in the extent of extra data analysis compared to the original study. However, it is essential to note that all fundamental aspects of the project, including the implementation of ranking models and query generation, were diligently pursued.

\subsubsection{Flexibility and Adaptation}
Throughout the project, flexibility and adaptability were demonstrated in response to the challenges encountered. This flexibility allowed for the management of the project's evolving timeline and the delivery of meaningful results. The adjustment in the schedule ensured that the project continued to meet its primary objectives, although some stages took longer than initially planned.

In summary, while the real timeline of the thesis project did not perfectly align with the initially projected timeline, the adjustments made were necessary to accommodate unforeseen challenges related to the computational environment. The project continued to meet its primary objectives, and any deviations from the initial plan were carefully considered and justified. The ability to adapt to changing circumstances is a valuable lesson learned during the course of this research.
